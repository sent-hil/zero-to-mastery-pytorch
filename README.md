Repo of me working through the [Zero To Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning"](https://www.learnpytorch.io). I use neovim with [jupynium](https://github.com/kiyoon/jupynium.nvim/).

## Setup

* Install `uv` with `brew`: `brew install uv`
* Install deps: `uv sync`
* Open `ch1.ju.py` in neovim and it should open jupyter site in Firefox and connect neovim to it.
